## Lightning aspects

* Lightning App Builder - a click driven tool for assembling Lightning components into apps, to run on the Salesforce1 Mobile App.

* Lightning Component - a framework for developing single-page applications that can be included in the Salesforce1 Mobile App. Create components wiht JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side.

* Lightning Component Extensions (Pilot) - allows you to extend the default Salesforce1 Mobile App UI.
 
* Lightning Process Builder - a click driven tool for building feature rich workflows in Salesforce, minimsing the need for triggers.

* Lightning Schema Builder - visualise all the objects & relationships in your Salesforce Org, creating and modifying custom objects. 

* Lightning Connect - use data from external sources with Salesforce via a powerful point click interface.  Easily connecting your Org with a growning number of OData sources.

> “OData can be considered as the ODBC API for the Web/Cloud” – Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard API independent of programming language for doing Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) methods on most of the popular relational databases.

> “OData is a data silo buster” 

## Salesforce1 Mobile App

  A mobile app available for Android, iOS and Windows mobile.  A hybrid application that reduced the need for Salesforce customers to build their own mobile app in order to interact with their Salesforce Org.

  Lightning components allow you to build more functionality into your Salesforce1 Mobile Apps, with less coding required.
